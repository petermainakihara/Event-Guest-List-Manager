# Event Guest List Manager

This is a simple web app that lets users add, RSVP, and remove guests from an event guest list using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add a guest by typing a name and clicking "Add"
- Mark guests as "Attending" or "Not Attending

## How It Works

When a guest is added, their name appears in a list. Each guest entry has two buttons:
- **RSVP**: Toggle between "Attending" and "Not Attending"
- **Remove**: Deletes the guest from the list

## Files

project-folder/
├── index.html # The HTML structure
├── style.css # Styling for the page
└── src/
└── index.js # JavaScript logic


## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

> No additional setup is required — all logic runs in the browser.

## Stretch Ideas

- Add categories like Friend, Family, Colleague
- Save list to localStorage so it stays after refresh
